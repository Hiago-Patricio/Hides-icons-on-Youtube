# Hides-icons-on-Youtube

This extension was develop to solve my personal problem which is to take a screenshot of a paused video on Youtube, but it has buttons in front of the content that get in the way.

This extension was created for Google Chrome, to use it you'll need enable developer mode in chrome://extensions/ and load the extension uncompressed.

To toggle the visibility of buttons you can click on the extension icon or use Ctrl+Shift+L.
